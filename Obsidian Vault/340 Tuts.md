void * pointer
- void * is a pointer type that represents a pointer to an unspecified type
- Variables with type void * can be used to print to objects of different types without the need for type conversion
- Cannot dereference it directly or perform arithmetic on it. You must first cast it to a specific pointer type before you can use it to access the object it points to
