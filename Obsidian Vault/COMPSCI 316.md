General Data Protection Regulation **GDPR**

- EU DPD Data Protection Directive
	- Component of EU privacy and human rights
	- Deals with protection and processing of personal data
	- does not protect personal data of EU citizens outside of the EU
	
- GDPR Replaces DPD **SUMMARY**
	- Legally protects citizens even out of EU
	- Photos, audio, video, transactions, social media,
	- Device identifiers (IP, IMEI)
	- Browsing History
	- and Genetic Info
	- Harmonises Data privacy laws across EU
	- Protects citizens
	- Reshapes the way organisations approach privacy

- Data Definition
	- Personal Data
		- Any info related to you, ID, Gender, Address
	- De-Identified Data
		- Personal data without the identifiers
		- E.g anon post in facebook group
	- Anonymized Data
		- Personal data where it is impossible to re-identify
		- E.G Average age of first home buyers.

- Common Terms
	- Data subject
		- Any person whose personal data is being collected, held or processed, e.g US
	- Data Controller
		- An entity that determines the purposes of this data
		- E.G UoA
	- Data Processor
		- The entity that handles the personal data on behalf of the controllers
		- Google

- GDPR Principles
	- Lawfullness fairness and transparency
	- Purpose limitations
		- Must not be used in ways unknown to the client
	- Data minimisation
		- States that only data directly relevant to a specified purpose can be collected
	- Accuracy
		- Data gathered from clients must be stored correctly and updated regularly
	- Confidentiality and Integrity
		- Confidentiality
			- Only those with requisite and authorisation can retrieve data
		- Integrity
			- Retreived data can only be altered by the person authorised to.
	- Accountability
		- Requires you to take responsibility with what you do with personal data and how you comply with the other principles

GDPR Changes
- Increased territorail scope
	- GDPR applies to all data processing companys with EU data subjects
	- GDPR applies to data controllers 
- Penalties
	- An organisation breaching GDPR can be fined up to 4% of their global turnover or 20 Million.
	- This is the maximum fine for the most serious infringements
		- E.g not having consumer consent.

- Consent
	- Must be given in a easily accessible form.
		- With the purpose of data processing attached in the consent
	- Must be obtained using clear and plain language
	- Can easily withdraw

- Breach Notification
	- Mandatory to notify where databreach is likely to result in a risk for the rights and freedoms of people.
	- Must be done within 72 hours of beoming aware of the breach
	- Data controllers and processors are required to notify their customers
- Right to Access
	- A confirmation from data controllers
		- Tells you whether or not personal data is being processed, where and for what purpose
	- The controller shall provide a copy of personal data
		- Free of charge and in electronic format
	- Dramatic shift from DPD to data trnasparency and empowerment to subjects
- Right to be Forgotten
	- Also known as data erasure
	- It entitles data subjects to have the data controller erase their data
	- This right requires controllers to check the public interest in the availability of the data
- Data portability
	- The right of subjects to receive personal data that have been provided to a data controller
	- In a structured way, commonly used and machine readable.
	- Subjects have the right to request the data to transmit their data to another controller
	- Only applies for personal data not anonymous
- Privacy by Design
	- Inclusion of data protection from the early stages of system design
		- rather than an addition
	- The controller shall implement data protection through design
	- The controller can hold and process only the data necessary for the completion of its duties 
		- Data minimisation

## Lecture 4

- Identification and Authentication
	- Identification
		- The process in which a system entity provides its claimed identity e.g UPI
	- Authentication
		- The process of verifying an identity claimed by a system entity, e.g password

- Password Vulnerabilities
	- Offline Dictionary Attack
		- Through strong access control, attackers can gain access to password files (hash values)
		- Comparing password hashes against hashes of commonly used passwords e.g iLoveYou. 
		- Countermeasures
			- Prevent unauthorised access to password files.
				- Intrusion detections measures to identify a compromise
			- Rapid reissuance of passwords
	- Specific Account Attack
		- Attacker targets a specific account
		- Submits password guesses until successful
		- Countermeasures
			- Lockout
			- Progressive delay after each try
	- Popular password Attack
		- Users tend to choose easily remembered passwords
		- This makes them easy to guess
		- Attacks can try commonly used passwords against a wide range of user IDs.
		- Countermeasures
			- Enforcing complex password policies
			- Scanning IP addresses and client cookies for submission patterns e.g dynamic password policies (policies for each individual person)
			- Intrusion detection
	- Password guessing against a single user
		- Gaining knowledge about an individual user
		- Knowing system password policies
		- Difference is they know you as a person and have more information about you than a regular hacker
		- Using both to guess a password
		- Countermeasures
			- Educating users
			- Enforcing complex password policies
	- Workstation hijacking
		- The attacker waits until a logged-in workstation is unattended
		- Countermeasures
			- Logging out after a certain period of inactivity
			- Intrusion detection schemes can be used to detect changes in user behaviour
	- Exploiting User Mistakes
		- Users are likely to write down the system assignment passwords
		- The fundamental issue is those passwords might be difficult to remember
		- Attackers can use social engineering tricks that trick the user into revealing a password
		- Many systems are shipped with default passwords for admins
		- Countermeasures
			- Changing default passwords
			- Educating users
	- Exploiting Same Password use
		- User s intend to choose the same password for different services
		- Attackers can learn password from one source
		- They can try the same password for other services that might be used by the user
		- Countermeasure
			- Educating users: Choose different passwords
	- Electronic Monitoring
		- Communicating a password in plaintext is vulnerable to eavesdropping
		- Countermeasures
			- Never send a password in plaintext
			- Technical solutions for secure transfer of passwords

- Password Protection
	- Salt with hash
		- To mitigate some password vulnerabilities, e.g same passwords have the same hash value
		- Salt is a random number
		- Increases attackers workload
		- At the time of registration the server can store
			- UserID
			- Salt
			- Salted Password Hash
		- Verifying Password Salt with Hash
			- The user provides UserID and password
			- Lookup the corresponding salt and hash
		- Random Salt Benefits
			- Difficult to guess if one user chooses the same password for multiple services
			- Difficult to guess if multiple users choose the same password for a single server (or more)
			- Makes offline dictionary attack difficult
			- Protection against rainbow tables, pre computed hash values (e.g with every possible salt), the solution is to use a large salt.
	- Multi-Factor Authentication
		- Different factors or means of authentication
			- Something you know, pin or password
			- Something you have (token) e.g smartcard
			- Something you are (static biometrics), fingerprint
			- Something you do (dynamic biometrics), voice or behavior
		- 2 or more for 2-factor or multifactor.

## Lecture 5

- Authorisation
	- A process of granting rights or permissions to a system entity
	- To provide access to a given resource
	- This is also known as **access control**
- Access Control Requirements
	- Reliable inputs
		- Authenticated entities
			- E.g using UPI and password
		- Genuine information
			- E.g student or staff member
	- Principle of Least privilege
		- Deals with granting the minimum set of access rights to do a job
		- Accessing a single course vs all courses
		- Grants the user the least amount of access they could have to do what they need to do (my words)
	- Administrative Duties
		- Only a special entity should be able to manage access rights
		- E.g. granting revoking or updating access rights.
- Access Control Elements
	- Subject
		- A user
		- An entity than can access objects
		- Or a process that is representing a user/application
	- Object
		- An entity that needs  to be protected
			- E.g files directories or other resources
	- Access Right
		- An access right r describes how a subject s can access an object o
		- E.g read write execute create delete and search
- Access Control System
	- Access control function f(s, o, r)
		- It looks up access right r for the combintiopn (s,o)
		- On a successful match, it grants access, otherwise not
	- Security Administrator
		- An entity that managed access rights
	- Auditor
		- An entity that inspects the whole authorisation system
- A typical Access Control System
	- ![[Pasted image 20240731184219.png]]
- Access Control Models
	- Discretionary Access Control (DAC)\
		- Resource owner decides who can access and level of access, i.e. the owner may grant access to subjects
		- Access is granted based on identity of the requester
		- These mechanisms are adequate for honest users
		- Vulnerable to trojan horses
		- DAC is used in operating systems
			- E.g linux file permissions: rwxr-x--x, read(r), write(w), execute(x)
		- Access Control Matrix
			- ![[Pasted image 20240731184806.png]]
			- ![[Pasted image 20240731190120.png]]
			- ![[Pasted image 20240731190129.png]]
	- Mandatory Access Control (MAC)
	- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
		- RBAC maps roles (e.g in an organisation) to access rights.
		- Similar to DAC but is to a role rather than an individual
		- Supports complex access control
		- Reduces errors in administration compared to user-assigned access.
		- Ease of administration
			- Move users in and out of roles
			- Move permissions in and out of roles
			- Very flexibile, compliance within organisation
		- Least privilege
			- Restricted access according to needs
			- Separation of duties through constraints
		- RBAC Model
			- User
				- Employees / Human Being
			- Permissions
				- Approval of a mode of access to some object
			- Roles
				- Job title
			- Assignments
				- user-role and role-perm
			- Session
				- Mapping of users to roles
			- Constraints
				- Restrictions that can be placed: e.g sessions, assignments, and roles
		- Core RBAC
			- ![[Pasted image 20240731185738.png]]'![[Pasted image 20240731185810.png]]
	- Usage control (UCON)
	-  Policy-Based Access Control (PBAC)


## Lecture 6

-  Malware
	- Malware is a set of instructions that run on your computer and make your system do something that an attacker wants it to do.
	- A bad program that aims at compromising CIA of the data, applications or system.
	- Malware Types
		- Virus
			- An executable or script that replicates itself
		- Worm
			- A computer program that can run independently and propagate itself over the network
			- Exploit vulnerabilities
		- Trojan Horse
			- It appears to have a useful function but also has a hidden and potentially malicious function
		- Spyware
			- Software that collects information from and transmits it to another system
			- E.g monitoring keystrokes network traffic or sensitive information
		- Ransomware
			- Stealing data and asking money to get it back
			- Victims are individuals and organisations
		- Botnets (robot and network)
			- Receive commands from remote Command and Control C&C servers
			- E.g. used for Distributed DoS (DDoS)
		- Document Based Malware
			- ![[Pasted image 20240801021242.png]]
			- How does document-based malware work?
				- The malware embeds malicious codes into documents, PDFs, spreadsheets, and other files
				- Once on your computer, it can perform various malicious tasks:
					- such as stealing passwords or infecting your email contacts
				- The malware replaces ordinary commands with malicious code
				- The worst part is that you can activate the malware through normal day-to-day tasks such as opening your emails or editing Word documents
				- Document-based malware overrides your commands, altering your computer, causing damage and further spreading the malicious code.
				- Often, the malware tampers with word processors by adding, deleting, and changing words within your documents
				- Further, it moves texts, adds images, and corrupts your hard drive.
				- In addition, it can infiltrate your email, sending unsolicited emails to your contact list. Unsuspecting recipients will open your emails in good faith, spreading the virus into their computers.
				- Archive and script files are also a common method for distributing attachment-based malware.
		- Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)
			- Advanced
				- Using a wide variety of intrusion technologies and malware
			- Persistent
				- Applied persistently and effectively to specific targets
				- Runs over an extended period
			- Often attributed to state-sponsored organisations
			- Example
				- Stuxnet, designed by US and Israeli intelligence to disable Iranian nuclear system
		- Zero-Day and backdoor
			- Zero-day vulnerability (exploit)
				- An unknown flaw that is discovered but does not have a patch or other fix (0-day to prepare a patch)
				- It can be exploited by cybercriminals
			- Backdoor
				- Any mechanism that bypasses a normal security beck
				- It may allow unauthorised access to data or program functionalities
		- Social Engineering
			- Psychological manipulation to trick users into doing security mistakes or giving away sensitive information
		- Phishing is the most popular type
			- Email and text message aimed at creating a sense of urgency, curiosity or fear in victims
			- Tricks users into
				- Revealing sensitive information
				- Clicking on links to malicious websites
				- Opening attachments that contain malware
- Malware Countermeasures
	- Use anti-virus, phishing detection systems, blacklisting IPs, firewalls, malware detection.
	- Patch your machine
	- Detect and prevent
		- Intrusion detection System (IDS)
		- Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)
	- Educate Users
