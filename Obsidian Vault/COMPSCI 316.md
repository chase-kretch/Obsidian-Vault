General Data Protection Regulation **GDPR**

- EU DPD Data Protection Directive
	- Component of EU privacy and human rights
	- Deals with protection and processing of personal data
	- does not protect personal data of EU citizens outside of the EU
	
- GDPR Replaces DPD **SUMMARY**
	- Legally protects citizens even out of EU
	- Photos, audio, video, transactions, social media,
	- Device identifiers (IP, IMEI)
	- Browsing History
	- and Genetic Info
	- Harmonises Data privacy laws across EU
	- Protects citizens
	- Reshapes the way organisations approach privacy

- Data Definition
	- Personal Data
		- Any info related to you, ID, Gender, Address
	- De-Identified Data
		- Personal data without the identifiers
		- E.g anon post in facebook group
	- Anonymized Data
		- Personal data where it is impossible to re-identify
		- E.G Average age of first home buyers.

- Common Terms
	- Data subject
		- Any person whose personal data is being collected, held or processed, e.g US
	- Data Controller
		- An entity that determines the purposes of this data
		- E.G UoA
	- Data Processor
		- The entity that handles the personal data on behalf of the controllers
		- Google

- GDPR Principles
	- Lawfullness fairness and transparency
	- Purpose limitations
		- Must not be used in ways unknown to the client
	- Data minimisation
		- States that only data directly relevant to a specified purpose can be collected
	- Accuracy
		- Data gathered from clients must be stored correctly and updated regularly
	- Confidentiality and Integrity
		- Confidentiality
			- Only those with requisite and authorisation can retrieve data
		- Integrity
			- Retreived data can only be altered by the person authorised to.
	- Accountability
		- Requires you to take responsibility with what you do with personal data and how you comply with the other principles

GDPR Changes
- Increased territorail scope
	- GDPR applies to all data processing companys with EU data subjects
	- GDPR applies to data controllers 
- Penalties
	- An organisation breaching GDPR can be fined up to 4% of their global turnover or 20 Million.
	- This is the maximum fine for the most serious infringements
		- E.g not having consumer consent.

- Consent
	- Must be given in a easily accessible form.
		- With the purpose of data processing attached in the consent
	- Must be obtained using clear and plain language
	- Can easily withdraw

- Breach Notification
	- Mandatory to notify where databreach is likely to result in a risk for the rights and freedoms of people.
	- Must be done within 72 hours of beoming aware of the breach
	- Data controllers and processors are required to notify their customers
- Right to Access
	- A confirmation from data controllers
		- Tells you whether or not personal data is being processed, where and for what purpose
	- The controller shall provide a copy of personal data
		- Free of charge and in electronic format
	- Dramatic shift from DPD to data trnasparency and empowerment to subjects
- Right to be Forgotten
	- Also known as data erasure
	- It entitles data subjects to have the data controller erase their data
	- This right requires controllers to check the public interest in the availability of the data
- Data portability
	- The right of subjects to receive personal data that have been provided to a data controller
	- In a structured way, commonly used and machine readable.
	- Subjects have the right to request the data to transmit their data to another controller
	- Only applies for personal data not anonymous
- Privacy by Design
	- Inclusion of data protection from the early stages of system design
		- rather than an addition
	- The controller shall implement data protection through design
	- The controller can hold and process only the data necessary for the completion of its duties 
		- Data minimisation

## Lecture 4

- Identification and Authentication
	- Identification
		- The process in which a system entity provides its claimed identity e.g UPI
	- Authentication
		- The process of verifying an identity claimed by a system entity, e.g password

- Password Vulnerabilities
	- Offline Dictionary Attack
		- Through strong access control, attackers can gain access to password files (hash values)
		- Comparing password hashes against hashes of commonly used passwords e.g iLoveYou. 
		- Countermeasures
			- Prevent unauthorised access to password files.
				- Intrusion detections measures to identify a compromise
			- Rapid reissuance of passwords
	- Specific Account Attack
		- Attacker targets a specific account
		- Submits password guesses until successful
		- Countermeasures
			- Lockout
			- Progressive delay after each try
	- Popular password Attack
		- Users tend to choose easily remembered passwords
		- This makes them easy to guess
		- Attacks can try commonly used passwords against a wide range of user IDs.
		- Countermeasures
			- Enforcing complex password policies
			- Scanning IP addresses and client cookies for submission patterns e.g dynamic password policies (policies for each individual person)
			- Intrusion detection
	- Password guessing against a single user
		- Gaining knowledge about an individual user
		- Knowing system password policies
		- Difference is they know you as a person and have more information about you than a regular hacker
		- Using both to guess a password
		- Countermeasures
			- Educating users
			- Enforcing complex password policies
	- Workstation hijacking
		- The attacker waits until a logged-in workstation is unattended
		- Countermeasures
			- Logging out after a certain period of inactivity
			- Intrusion detection schemes can be used to detect changes in user behaviour
	- Exploiting User Mistakes
		- Users are likely to write down the system assignment passwords
		- The fundamental issue is those passwords might be difficult to remember
		- Attackers can use social engineering tricks that trick the user into revealing a password
		- Many systems are shipped with default passwords for admins
		- Countermeasures
			- Changing default passwords
			- Educating users
	- Exploiting Same Password use
		- User s intend to choose the same password for different services
		- Attackers can learn password from one source
		- They can try the same password for other services that might be used by the user
		- Countermeasure
			- Educating users: Choose different passwords
	- Electronic Monitoring
		- Communicating a password in plaintext is vulnerable to eavesdropping
		- Countermeasures
			- Never send a password in plaintext
			- Technical solutions for secure transfer of passwords

- Password Protection
	- Salt with hash
		- To mitigate some password vulnerabilities, e.g same passwords have the same hash value
		- Salt is a random number
		- Increases attackers workload
		- At the time of registration the server can store
			- UserID
			- Salt
			- Salted Password Hash
		- Verifying Password Salt with Hash
			- The user provides UserID and password
			- Lookup the corresponding salt and hash
		- Random Salt Benefits
			- Difficult to guess if one user chooses the same password for multiple services
			- Difficult to guess if multiple users choose the same password for a single server (or more)
			- Makes offline dictionary attack difficult
			- Protection against rainbow tables, pre computed hash values (e.g with every possible salt), the solution is to use a large salt.
	- Multi-Factor Authentication
		- Different factors or means of authentication
			- Something you know, pin or password
			- Something you have (token) e.g smartcard
			- Something you are (static biometrics), fingerprint
			- Something you do (dynamic biometrics), voice or behavior
		- 2 or more for 2-factor or multifactor.

## Lecture 5

- Authorisation
	- A process of granting rights or permissions to a system entity
	- To provide access to a given resource
	- This is also known as **access control**
- Access Control Requirements
	- Reliable inputs
		- Authenticated entities
			- E.g using UPI and password
		- Genuine information
			- E.g student or staff member
	- Principle of Least privilege
		- Deals with granting the minimum set of access rights to do a job
		- Accessing a single course vs all courses
		- Grants the user the least amount of access they could have to do what they need to do (my words)
	- Administrative Duties
		- Only a special entity should be able to manage access rights
		- E.g. granting revoking or updating access rights.
- Access Control Elements
	- Subject
		- A user
		- An entity than can access objects
		- Or a process that is representing a user/application
	- Object
		- An entity that needs  to be protected
			- E.g files directories or other resources
	- Access Right
		- An access right r describes how a subject s can access an object o
		- E.g read write execute create delete and search
- Access Control System
	- Access control function f(s, o, r)
		- It looks up access right r for the combintiopn (s,o)
		- On a successful match, it grants access, otherwise not
	- Security Administrator
		- An entity that managed access rights
	- Auditor
		- An entity that inspects the whole authorisation system
- A typical Access Control System
	- ![[Pasted image 20240731184219.png]]
- Access Control Models
	- Discretionary Access Control (DAC)\
		- Resource owner decides who can access and level of access, i.e. the owner may grant access to subjects
		- Access is granted based on identity of the requester
		- These mechanisms are adequate for honest users
		- Vulnerable to trojan horses
		- DAC is used in operating systems
			- E.g linux file permissions: rwxr-x--x, read(r), write(w), execute(x)
		- Access Control Matrix
			- ![[Pasted image 20240731184806.png]]
			- ![[Pasted image 20240731190120.png]]
			- ![[Pasted image 20240731190129.png]]
	- Mandatory Access Control (MAC)
	- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
		- RBAC maps roles (e.g in an organisation) to access rights.
		- Similar to DAC but is to a role rather than an individual
		- Supports complex access control
		- Reduces errors in administration compared to user-assigned access.
		- Ease of administration
			- Move users in and out of roles
			- Move permissions in and out of roles
			- Very flexibile, compliance within organisation
		- Least privilege
			- Restricted access according to needs
			- Separation of duties through constraints
		- RBAC Model
			- User
				- Employees / Human Being
			- Permissions
				- Approval of a mode of access to some object
			- Roles
				- Job title
			- Assignments
				- user-role and role-perm
			- Session
				- Mapping of users to roles
			- Constraints
				- Restrictions that can be placed: e.g sessions, assignments, and roles
		- Core RBAC
			- ![[Pasted image 20240731185738.png]]'![[Pasted image 20240731185810.png]]
	- Usage control (UCON)
	-  Policy-Based Access Control (PBAC)


## Lecture 6

-  Malware
	- Malware is a set of instructions that run on your computer and make your system do something that an attacker wants it to do.
	- A bad program that aims at compromising CIA of the data, applications or system.
	- Malware Types
		- Virus
			- An executable or script that replicates itself
		- Worm
			- A computer program that can run independently and propagate itself over the network
			- Exploit vulnerabilities
		- Trojan Horse
			- It appears to have a useful function but also has a hidden and potentially malicious function
		- Spyware
			- Software that collects information from and transmits it to another system
			- E.g monitoring keystrokes network traffic or sensitive information
		- Ransomware
			- Stealing data and asking money to get it back
			- Victims are individuals and organisations
		- Botnets (robot and network)
			- Receive commands from remote Command and Control C&C servers
			- E.g. used for Distributed DoS (DDoS)
		- Document Based Malware
			- ![[Pasted image 20240801021242.png]]
			- How does document-based malware work?
				- The malware embeds malicious codes into documents, PDFs, spreadsheets, and other files
				- Once on your computer, it can perform various malicious tasks:
					- such as stealing passwords or infecting your email contacts
				- The malware replaces ordinary commands with malicious code
				- The worst part is that you can activate the malware through normal day-to-day tasks such as opening your emails or editing Word documents
				- Document-based malware overrides your commands, altering your computer, causing damage and further spreading the malicious code.
				- Often, the malware tampers with word processors by adding, deleting, and changing words within your documents
				- Further, it moves texts, adds images, and corrupts your hard drive.
				- In addition, it can infiltrate your email, sending unsolicited emails to your contact list. Unsuspecting recipients will open your emails in good faith, spreading the virus into their computers.
				- Archive and script files are also a common method for distributing attachment-based malware.
		- Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)
			- Advanced
				- Using a wide variety of intrusion technologies and malware
			- Persistent
				- Applied persistently and effectively to specific targets
				- Runs over an extended period
			- Often attributed to state-sponsored organisations
			- Example
				- Stuxnet, designed by US and Israeli intelligence to disable Iranian nuclear system
		- Zero-Day and backdoor
			- Zero-day vulnerability (exploit)
				- An unknown flaw that is discovered but does not have a patch or other fix (0-day to prepare a patch)
				- It can be exploited by cybercriminals
			- Backdoor
				- Any mechanism that bypasses a normal security beck
				- It may allow unauthorised access to data or program functionalities
		- Social Engineering
			- Psychological manipulation to trick users into doing security mistakes or giving away sensitive information
		- Phishing is the most popular type
			- Email and text message aimed at creating a sense of urgency, curiosity or fear in victims
			- Tricks users into
				- Revealing sensitive information
				- Clicking on links to malicious websites
				- Opening attachments that contain malware
- Malware Countermeasures
	- Use anti-virus, phishing detection systems, blacklisting IPs, firewalls, malware detection.
	- Patch your machine
	- Detect and prevent
		- Intrusion detection System (IDS)
		- Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)
	- Educate Users

## Lecture 7

Usable Security Engineering 2

- Humans
	- Amateurs hack systems, professionals hack people
	- People often represent the weakest ilink in the security chain and are chronically responsible for the failure of security systems
	- If you think technology can solve your security problems, then you dont understand the problems and you dont understand the technology
	- Humans are incapable fof securely storing high-quality cryptographic keys, and they have unacceptable speed and accuracy when performing cryptographic operations
	- They are also large, epxensive to maintain, difficult to manage, and they pollute the environment we must design our protocols around their limitations

	- Password rules 
		- Lowercase, uppercase
		- Mix of numbers
		- Symbols
		- Min characters etc.
		- Humans are bad at making passwords!
		- ![[Pasted image 20240808141342.png]]
		- Famous people who you can easily find information about online are more suscepitble
- Usable Security: Interdisciplinary
	- Usable security is interdisciplinary nature. Other disciplines will consist of studying human bheavior
	- We can borrow their theories, frameworks models and methods:
		- Psychology
		- Sociology
		- Ethnography
		- Cognitive Sciences
		- Warning science
		- Risk perceptions
		- Organisational change
		- Behavioral economics
		- HCI
		- Marketing
		- Counterterrorism
		- Communication
		- Persuasive technology
		- Learning science
		- Network analytics
	- Usable security is not tradition Usability (HCI)
		- Security is not very often the primary task of the user
			- Many applications handle security issues through security alerts that interrupt users primary task
			- Users find it is distracting and therefore would rather ignore, circumvent or even defeat.
		- Securing information is about understanding risk and threats
			- They are usually overlooked in traditional HCI
		- What makes usable security different
			- Discrete technical problems are all well-understood under the umbrella of on-line security and privacy attacks
			- legitimate users + presence of an adversary
			- Systems should remain secure when
				- The attacker tries to fool/trick users
				- The user behaves in un/predictable ways
				- Using the system under stress, pressure or tension
				- The user is busy, careless or unmotivated
			- Usability (HCI) itself is insufficient to keep systems that remain secure
		- Better together = Security AND Usability
		- ![[Pasted image 20240808141854.png]]
		- Is all about designing systems that are secure and usable
		- Usable security bridges security and usability
		- Usable Security Table
			- ![[Pasted image 20240808141924.png]]
		- user selected graphical passwords
		- ![[Pasted image 20240808142024.png]]

	- Humans and Secure Systems
		- The human threat
			- Malicious humans
			- Clueless humans
			- Unmotivated humans
			- Humans constrained by human limitations
		- What can make a system unusable
			- Confusing/misleading/unhelpful user interface
			- Requiring user to make decisions for which user is not qualified
			- Knowledge or abilities that user does not have
			- Unreasonable amount of attention/effort
		- Understanding Humans in the loop
			- Do they know they are supposed to be doing something
			- Do they understand what they are supposed to do 
			- Do they know  how to do it
			- Are they motivated to do it
			- Are they capable of doing it
			- Human in the loop framework
				- Models human interaction with secure systems
				- Can help identify human threats

## Lecture 8

- Vulnerabilities
	- OWASP stands for Open web application security project
		- A community that investigates web security
		- OWASP top 10, the list of the 10 most seen vulnerabilities
			- It also shows their risk, impacts and countermeasures
			- Every 3-4 years
	- ![[Screenshot 2024-08-01 at 12.09.48 PM.png]]
- Injection
	- An injection flaw occurs when untrusted input gets processed as part of a command or query
	- The attacker can inject input data
		- The attacker can execute unintended commands
		- and can access unauthorised data
	- Examples
		- Command injection
		- SQL Injection
	- ![[Screenshot 2024-08-01 at 12.22.16 PM.png]]
	- ![[Screenshot 2024-08-01 at 12.17.14 PM.png]]
	- Countermeasures
		- Separation of data from application logic
		- Input validation
		- Setting to limit data exposure in case of successful injection attacks
		- Using parameterised queries to prevent injection flaws
- Broken Authentication
	- Application functions related to authentication and session management are often implemented incorrectly
	- This allows attackers to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens
	- Reasons
		- Allowing default, weak, or well-known passwords
		- Application session timeouts not set properly
	- Countermeasures
		- Use Multi-factor authentication
		- Do not use default credentials
		- Enforce strong password policies
		- Limit / increasingly delay failed login attempts
		- Securely use session ID and invalidate after logout, idle and timeouts
- Sensitive data exposure
	- Sensitive data requires protection as per EU GDPR and local privacy laws
		- Financial data
		- healthcare data
		- Personal Identification number (PII)
	- Many APIs do not properly protect sensitive data
	- The most common flaw is not encrypting sensitive data, e.g plain text by man-in-the-middle
	- Weak cipher suits
	- Storing hashed passwords without salts
	- Countermeasures
		- Identify sensitive data as per privacy laws
		- Do not store sensitive data unnecessarily
		- Make sure to protect all sensitive data
		- encrypt all data in transit
		- Use salt with password hashes
			- Also use a work factor (#iterations) i.e delay factor
- XML External Entities (XXE)
	- XML: extensible markup language
	- Many older or poorly configured XML processors evaluate external entity references within XML documents
	- External entities can be used to
		- Disclose internal files
		- Scan internal systems
		- Remote code execution
		- DoS by including a potentially endless file
	- Countermeasures
		- Patch or upgrade all XML processors and libraries
		- Disable XEE
		- Validate incoming XML
- Broken Access Control
	- Bypassing access control checks
	- Unauthenticated user accessing authenticated pages
	- A non-admin accessing admin pages
	- Countermeasures
		- Except public resources, deny by default
		- log access control failures
		- Set API rate limits: restricted number of requests to minimise harm from automated attacks
- Security Misconfiguration
	- Attackers often attempt to exploit unpatched flaws or access default accounts
	- An application server configuration with defaulted error messages
		- e.g stack traces
		- This can expose sensitive information
	- Countermeasures
		- Review and update configurations
		- An Automated process to validate the effectiveness of configurations and settings
			- Test in all possible environments
- Cross Site Scripting (XSS)
	- XSS flaws occur whenever untrusted data is injected but not validated
	- XSS allows attackers to execute scripts in the victims browser
		- Attracting users to click on the link containing evil script in URL
	- Countermeasures
		- Separating untrusted data from browser content
		- Using frameworks that automatically escape XSS by design
- Insecure deserialisation
- Using component with known vulnerabilities
- Insufficient logging and monitoring
- CVE & NVD
	- Common vulnerabilities and exposures
	- Nation Vulnerability Database
		- scored by CVSS Common Vulnerability Scoring System

## Lecture 9

Privacy Preserving Software Systems

- Trading Privacy for Convenience
	- Uber Data Breach
		- Concealed a hack that affected 57 million customesr and drivers.
		- Paid hackers 100 thousand to delete the data
	- Zoom Bombing
		- Unwanted person joining Zoom meeting interrupting eavesdropping, etc.
	- Privacy Threats of AMMI Safe Drive App
	- Twitters Privacy Policy
		- It would take the average internet user 244 hours to read every privacy policy for every website they visited in one year
		- In systems privacy policies should be presented in a way thats at all designed with the reader in mind rather than desgiend with the lawyers protecting themselves in mind
	- WhatsApp Updating Privacy Policy
		- Sharing users numbers with FaceBook for advertising
	- What the Study Did?
		- Identifying the problems programmers face when embedding privacy into software applications
		- Providing solutions to those problems are important to enable the development of privacy preserving software systems
		- This study investigates 36 software developers in a software design task
		- PRovided them with instructions to embed privacy in order to identify the rpoblems they face
	- What the Study Found
		- Developers have pratical issues when they attempt to embed privacy into software applications
		- They find it difficult torelate privacy requirements into engineering techniques
		- Privacy concepts may not work in software development environments
		- When developers lacked knowledge, their personal opinions and complex system requirements seem to take precedence over privacy requirements - resulted in software applications with limited or no privacy embedded at all.
	- Developing a methodology
		- ![[Pasted image 20240808140826.png]]
	- Software developers need an education too!
		- An educational intervention
		- Enhance developers secure coding behaviour through motivation
		- A serious game for teaching
		- ![[Pasted image 20240808140919.png]]
	- Future work
		- Empirically investigate the developed framework
		- Incorporating the framework into a gaming application
		- Investigate developers impact after their engagement with the gaming application

## Lecture 10

- Program Analysis
	- The process of analysing the behaviour of programs
	- THe main goal is to find problems in code
	- Program analysis can be performed
		- without execution (static analysis)
		- during runtime (dynamic)
		- by combining both (concolic execution)
	- Static Analysis
		- Without actually executing a program
		- Static analysis typically discover properties for all executions
		- Full coverage of source or binary
		- program-centric
		- A kind of white box testing
		- Scalable
		- Accuracy issues, false positives
		- Can be run before dynamic analysis
	- Dynamic Analysis
		- Running a program
		- Exposes vulnerabilities in the deployment environment
		- Difficult to generate and test all possibilities
		- Limited coverage
		- More accurate
		- Input-centric
		- A kind of black box testing
		- Can be run after static analysis
	- Control Flow Analysis
		- It is typically a static analysis technique for determining the control flow of a program
		- often used to test developers own program
		- The control flow is expressed as a Control Flow Graph (CFC) Possible execution sequences
	- Data Flow Analysis
		- A technique for gathering information about the possible set of values at specific points 
		- A CFG is used to determine those values 
		- A simple way is to set up data flow equations for each node in CFG
		- ![[Pasted image 20240814222018.png]]
	- Program Slicing
		- A static program analysis: reducing program to the minimum form that still produces the selected behaviour
		- The reduced program is called a slice
		- Generally, finding a slice is an unsolvable program; Possible to obtain approx slices using a data-flow algorithm
		- Used by developers during debugging to locate the source of errors
	- Symbolic Execution
		- A static analysis technique: executing the program with symbolic valued input ( as opposed to concrete valued input)
		- Both a path symbolically executed independently forming an execution tree
		- ![[Pasted image 20240814222204.png]]
	- C program with CFG
	- ![[Pasted image 20240814222341.png]]
	- ![[Pasted image 20240814222355.png]]
	- Concolic Execution
		- First static followed by dynamic
		- Motivation: Long path or complex path conditions for symbolic executions 
			- Concolic = Concrete + Symbolic
		- Concrete execution
			- A form of dynamic analysis
			- Takes path based on concrete input values
		- Also called dynamic symbolic execution
		- Used for analysing complex programs
		- ![[Pasted image 20240814222506.png]]

## Lecture 11

- Code Obfuscation
	- A promising technique to protect sensitive information in application code
		- e.g password match or licence check
	- Aims at hardening the process of reverse engineering
	- Code obfuscation can be broadly classified into four main categories (Balachandran TIFS13)
		- Layout
		- Design
		- Data
		- Control
- Layout Obfuscation
	- Refers to obscuring the layout of the program
	- Not affect executable part of the code
	- Examples:
		- Deleting comments
		- Removing debugging information
		- Renaming variables
- Design Obfuscation
	- Refers to obscuring the design intent of the software system
		- Particular for object-oriented applications, e.g splitting/merging classes
	- Aims at prevented the adversary from extracting information from the data used in the program
	- Examples
		- Encoding (encryption)
		- Variable splitting
			- Split v into p and q such that v = p XOR q
		- Changing lifetime of variables
			- e.g local <-> global
- Control Obfuscation
	- Or control flow obfuscation: obscure codes logic flow
	- Examples
		- Opaque prdicates: e.g if(A >0) easty to guess TRUE/FALSE but replace with if(A > (b^2+b)%2) etc. hard to guess.
		- Control flow flattening: break/change the structure of control flow graphs
		- ![[Pasted image 20240814223328.png]]
- Reverse Engineering
	- Process of analysing (e.g code) through deducting reasoning of what happens previously
	- Also called backwards/back engineering
- Summary
	- Code obfuscation is used in practice
	- Software developers use obfuscation 
		- tTo protect intellectual property
		- To make app repackaging difficult
	- Malware developers also use obfuscation to hide malicious code
	- There is an arms race between code obfuscation and reverse engineering

## Lecture 12

- The uncontrollable Nature of Threats
	- Threats cant be eliminated ie, they are always present
	- You cannot affect the threat itself
	- You can take action to reduce the potential for a threat to occur or reduce the impact of a threat
	- Unintentional Threats
		- Envuronmental
		- Human
		- Accidental
		- Failure
	- Intentional Threats
		- Greed

	- Occurs when a threat exploits a vulnerability
	- A vulnerability provides a path for the threat that results in a harmful event or a loss
	- Both the threat and vulnerability must come together to result in a loss
	- ![[Pasted image 20240815001731.png]]
	- Example
		- Threat Source
			- Unauthorised Users (hackers)

CPU Scheduling

- Basic Concepts
	- Maximum CPU itlisation obtained with multiprogramming
	- CPU I/O Burst Cycle - Process execution consists of a cycle of CPU execution and I/O wait
	- CPU Burst followed by I/O burst
	- CPU burst distribution is of main concern
- Histogram of CPU Burst Times
	- Large number of short CPU bursts
	- Small number of longer CPU bursts
	- ![[Pasted image 20240819174146.png]]
- CPU Scheduler
	- The CPU scheduler selects from among the processes in ready queue, and allocates a CPU core to one of them
		- Queue can be ordered in various ways
	- CPU scheduling decisions may take place when a process
		- Switches from running to waiting state
		- Switches from running to ready state
		- Switches from waiting to ready
		- Terminates
	- For situations 1 and 4, there is no choice on terms of scheduling - non preemptive or cooperative scheduling
	- For situations 2 and 3 however there is a choice - preemptive scheduling
	- Preemptive scheduling can result in race conditions
- Preemptive and NonPreemptive Schedling
	- Under Cooperative scheduling, once the CPu has been allocated to a process, the process keeps the CPu until it releases it either by terminating to process or switching to the waiting state
	- Preemptive scheduling can result in race conditions when data are shared among several processes
	- Consider the case of two processes that share data. While one process is updating the data, it is preempted so that the second process can run. The second process then tried to read the data which are in an inconsistent state
	- Virtually all modern operating systems including Windows, MacOS, Linux and UNIX use preemptive scheduling algorithms
- Dispatcher
	- Dispatcher module gives control of the CPU to the process selected by the CPU scheduler. This involves
		- Switching context
		- Switching to user mode
		- Jumping to the proper location in the user program to resume that program
	- Dispatch latency
		- Time it takes for the dispatcher to stop one process and start another running
- Scheduling Criteria
	- Maximise CPU utilisation
		- Keep the CPU as busy as possible
	- Maximise Throughput
		- Number of processes that complete their execution per time unit
	- Minimise Turnaround time
		- Amount of time to execute a particular process
	- Minimise Waiting time
		- Amount of time a process has been waiting in the ready queue
	- Minimise Response time
		- Amount of time it takes from when a request was submitted until the first response is produced
- First Come First Served (FCFS)
	- Reduces waiting time
	- No time wasted to determine which process should run next
	- Little overhead as context switch only when required
	- Non-preemptive
	- ![[Pasted image 20240819175416.png]]
	- Convoy Effect - short process behind long process
		- Consider one CPU-bound and many I/O-bound processes
		- Results in lower CPU and device utilisation
- Round Robin (RR)
	- pre-emptive version of FCFS
	- Need to determine the size of the time slice or time quantum
	- What is wrong with treating every process equally?
		- no concept of priorities
		- doesnt deal with different types of process, computer bound vs IO bound
	- One way to tune this is to change the length of the time slice
		- Less time using for context switches in long time slice
		- short time slice has a lot of context switches
- Shortest Job first (SJF)
	- SJF is optimal, gives minimum average waiting time for a given set of processes
	- Unfortunately, we dont know which process has the shortest CPU burst
	- Use the previous CPU bursts to estimate the next
	- Preemptive  SJF
		- Whenever a process arrives in the ready queue, with a shorter burst time then the remaining burst time of the running process then the process is preempted
		- Adds an arrival time value
		- Waiting time only starts from when the process arrives
		- ![[Pasted image 20240819180624.png]]
- Priority Scheduling
	- ![[Pasted image 20240819180802.png]]
- Handling Prioities
	- Explicit Priorities
		- Unchanging
		- Set before a process runs
		- When a new process arrives, it is placed in the position in the ready queue corresponding to its priority
		- It is possible to get indefinite block or starvation (low priority processes may never execute)
	- Variable Priorities
		- Priorities can vary over life of the process
		- The system makes changes according to the process' behaviour: CPU usage, IO usage, memory requirements etc
		- If a process is not running because it has a low priority
			- Solution - Aging (as time progresses increase the priority of the process)
			- or a process of a worse priority might be schedule after five processes of a better priority
			- This prevents starvation but better priority processes will still run more often

## Lecture 13

- Multi-Level queue scheduling
	- The ready queue consists of multiple queues
	- Multilevel queue scheduler defined by the following parameters
		- Number of queues
		- Scheduling algorithms for each queue
		- Method used to determine which queue a process will enter when that process needs service
		- Scheduling among the queues
		- A process stays on its original queue or can be moved from queue to queue
- Multiple-Processor Scheduling
	- Symmetric multiprocesses (SMP) is where each processor is self scheduling
	- Two kinds
		- All threads may be in a common ready queue
		- Each processor may have its own private queue of threads
	- ![[Pasted image 20240819222849.png]]
- Real time CPU Scheduling
	- Can present obvious challenges
	- Soft real-time systems - critical real-time tasks have the highest priority but no guarantee as to when tasks will be scheduled
	- Hard real-time systems - tasks must be serviced by its deadline
	- When processes are submitted, they indicate their CPU requirements
	- The scheduler may reject the process if the requirement cannot be met
	- But very important processes can force other processes to relinquish their allocations
	- Event latency - the amount of time that elapses from when an event occurs to when it is services
	- Two types of latencies affect performance
		- Interrupt latency - time from arrival of interrupt to start of routine that services interrupt
		- Dispatch latency - time for schedule to take current process off CPU and switch to another (context switch)
			- Conflict phase of dispatch latency
				- Preemption of any process running in kernel mode
					- Will only occur after process exits critical section
				- Release by low-priority process of resources needed by high-priority resources
	- For real time schedling, the job is the scheduler must support preemptive, priority -based scheduling
		- But only guarantees soft real-time functionality
		- No guarantee for itll meet deadline
	- For hard real-time must also provide ability to meet deadlines
	- (c,p,d) tuple
		- computation time (worst case)
		- period time
		- deadline
		- c <= d <= p
- Periodic Process
	- require CPu at constant intervals
	- used for polling, monitoring and sampling
	- predetermined amount of work every period
	- Period and deadline are determined by the system requirements (often the same)
	- Computation time is found through analysis, measurement or simulation
	- When the computation is complete the process is blocked util the next period starts
	- Sometimes it doesnt matter if the deadline extends period time, or the period can change depending on system load.
- Sporadic Process
	- event driven - some external signal or change
	- used for fault detection, change of operating modes
	- (c,p,d) still applies
	- c and d have the obvious meaning
	- p is the minimum time between events
	- aperiodic processes
	- p = 0
	- events can happen at any time, even simultaneously
	- timing can no longer be deterministic but there are ways of handling this
		- statistical methods we design to satisfy average response times
		- if it is rare that the system has timing faults then special cases can be included in the handling code
		- e.g user presses a keyboard
- Cyclic executives (CEs)
	- handles periodic processes
	- Sporadic processes can be converted into equivalent periodic processes or they can be ignored (if they take only a little time to handle)
	- Pre-schedules - a feasible execution schedule is calculated before run time
	- The cyclic executive carries out this schedule
	- it is periodic
	- Highly predictable - non pre-emptible
	- Inflexible, difficult to maintain
	- CE Schedule
		- Major schedule - cyclic allocation of processor blocks which satisfies all deadlines and periods
		- ![[Pasted image 20240819230151.png]]
		- Minor cycle (or frame)  - major schedules are divided into equal size frames. Clock ticks only occur on the frame boundaries
	- Periodic Processes 
		- A = (1, 10, 10) B = (3, 10, 10), C = (2, 20, 20) D = (8, 20, 20)
		- Major cycle time is 20 (smallest possible value we can use in this case). LCM of periods.
		- Frame time - can be 10, GCD of periods
		- ![[Pasted image 20240819230232.png]]
	- Scheduling with Priorities
		- Scheduling decisions are made
			- When a process becomes ready
			- wehn a process completes it execution
			- when there is an interrupt
		- Priorities can cause schedules to not be feasible
			- A(1,2,2) better priority
			- B(2,5,5) worse priority
		- This is feasible (without preemption) but if the priorities are reverssed it is not
		- Still priorities are almost always used
			- fixed - determined before execution
			- dynamic - change during execution
	- Priority Allocation
		- Fixed
			- Rate monotonic (RM) - the shorter the period the higher the priority
			- Least compute time (LCT) - the shorter the execution time the higher the priority (shortest job first)
		- Dynamic
			- Shorted completion time (SCT) - shortest job first with preemption. But this time we have good information on the execution time requirement
			- Earliest deadline first (EDF) - the process with the closest deadline has the highest priority
			- Least slack time (LST) - the process with the least slack time has the ighest priority
				- Slack time is the amount of time to the process deadline minus the amount of time the process still needs to complete
